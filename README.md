# CurlMap 🌍🥌

**CurlMap** is an open-source project that provides an interactive world map of curling clubs and bonspiels (tournaments).  
The goal is to create a free, community-driven atlas where anyone can:

- 🌍 Explore curling clubs worldwide  
- 🧊 See club details (ice sheets, indoor/outdoor, year opened, address)  
- 📅 Discover upcoming and past bonspiels (tournaments)  
- 🔎 Filter by region, ice sheets, or search by city/club name  

Powered by **Leaflet** and **OpenStreetMap**, fully free to host on **GitHub Pages** or migrate to any custom domain.
